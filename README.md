# sorting-algorithms
In this project we are making several sorting algorithms in python.
We are going to attempt to make a bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort and bogo sort.

Ignore the "le sort", it is french sort

The visualizer was made by Lex, later on we changed the code to fit onto the other sorting algorithm.
The visualizer was made using matplotlib.
